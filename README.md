# Wagago

This repo is for my implementations of the "jlox" interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

"wagago" is romaji for "我が語" which can be loosely translated into "my language"

## C# interpreter

This interpreter is almost identical to the "jlox" interpreter outlined for Java in the Crafting 
Interpreters book.

Some changes include:
* Support for modules via files
